# DSA using C++ Language

### This repository contains all the coding problems solved by me.

* Find all topic wise questions in different folders:)
* From Basic to Hard level questions under each topic
* Problems are from Leetcode and Geeksforgeeks website.
* Separate folders for CP. All Solutions are not optimised 

## Big O Notation
### Data Structures in Big O Notation
| Data Structure | Add/Insert | Remove/Delete | Access/Get | Search/Contains | Space Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Array | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
<!-- | Queue | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Stack | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| HashSet | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | - | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| HashMap | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` |

| Doubly LinkedList | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Circular Singly LinkedList | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Circular Doubly LinkedList | ```O(1)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Binary Search Tree | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| Binary Min Heap | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(1)``` | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n)``` |

### Sorting Algorithms in Big O Notiation
| Sort Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst | Space Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selection Sort | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(1)``` |
| Bubble Sort | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(1)``` |
| Insertion Sort | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(1)``` |
| Quick Sort | ```O(nlog n)``` | ```O(nlog n)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(log n)``` |
| Merge Sort | ```O(nlog n)``` | ```O(nlog n)``` | ```O(nlog n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
| counting Sort | ```O(n+k)``` | ```O(n+k)``` | ```O(n+k)``` | ```O(k)``` |
